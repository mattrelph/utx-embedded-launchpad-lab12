UTX Embedded - Lab 12 - Tuning Fork

Purpose
This lab has these major objectives: 1) the understanding and implementing of interrupt software; 2) interfacing an output pin to the speaker, so that the software can generate a quiet buzzing sound at 440 Hz; and 3) the study the accuracy of the pitch created with interrupts. Please read the entire lab before starting.

System Requirements
In this lab you will make a square wave sound at 440 Hz, which is a standard frequency created by a tuning fork. You will interface a positive logic switch as the input, and you will interface the headphones as an output. The choices for input/output pins supported by the graders is listed in Tables 12.1 and 12.2. A resistor placed in series with the headphones will control the loudness of the sound, see Figure 12.1. Any value between 680 Ω and 2 kΩ will be OK. Selecting a larger the resistor will make the sound quieter. Please do not leave this resistor off entirely.
